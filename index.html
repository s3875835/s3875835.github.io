   <h1>What got you interested in I.T?</h1>
  <p style="color:red;">I wanted to study I.T because Ive been very interested <br> in it ever since i was little. </p>
  <p style="color:red;"> My interest in I.T started when my mum was taking <br> classes on how to use the internet. </p>
  <p style="color:red;">I thought why not listen in to give my mum some tips on <br> what to do and how to do it.<p/>

   <h1> Why R.M.I.T? </h1>
  <p style="color:red;"> Well I've wanted to go to R.M.I.T for a while now <br> because of the Indigenous Program they have there and I think its a good place to start.</p>
